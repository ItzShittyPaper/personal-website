<p>btw the site is back up, with some changes and quality of life improvements</p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>im planning on releasing a satirical tech news site one day, currently working on it.
i&rsquo;ll make a post about it in a few weeks
also im working on a vidya game, and that shit takes a ton of time i guess</p>
<p>this place is a huge burden on me really, it&rsquo;s hard to update, the codebase is shit and i don&rsquo;t really have much to say, so there are like 4 posts a year. that means that even IF someone sees this, they&rsquo;ll think that the site is dead and no one works on it anymore. the thing is when i closed it many people online wondered where it went, so i couldn&rsquo;t just leave it like that. so here it is again. have fun!</p>
