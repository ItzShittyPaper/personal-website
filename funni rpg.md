# funny rpg game: le desugen document

1. several "gamemodes" with different mechanics
	- main mode / game world
	- dialog mode
	- battle mode
	- management / inventory mode

	these will be the main modes of the game, additional modes that will be separate from the rest of the game will be:
	- npc trade mode
	- main menu mode

2. main mode
	this is the "hub mode"
	all of the other modes will be activated from the world screen
	here you move your player character, talk to people, interact with the game's world and generally explore

	here you can see your character and your party members just chilling.
	there won't be any big challenges in this mode, the player should be realxed walking in the game

3. dialog mode
	most of the story will be told via dialog boxes
	this mode will be activated when talking to a character / npc etc.
	here the game will freeze so the player can focus on reading the story

4. battle mode
	the battle screen
	all of 4 party members will often fight against one, or multiple enemies
	every member will have their own attacks, depending on their class, stats and equipped items
	when a party member loses all of their health they faint, forcing the remaining party members to pick their body up (the body will act like a heavy item, taking up a ton of inventory space) to escort them to the nearest hospital
	after a specific time the unconcious party member will die never appearing in the game later (with small exceptions like dream sequences etc.)
	you can keep the unconcious member alive by giving them specific items, also they die slower when picked up, letting the player revive them in a hospital.

5. management / inventory mode
	basically the inventory screen.
	every party member will have their own inventory, letting them carry rations, weapons etc.
	the inventory space is shared, meaning that in most conditions the player can - for example - give food to a specific party member from another members inventory
	everyone can equip 2 weapons (or a single weapon and something else) at the same time, some weapons will take up 2 slots at the same time.
	these weapons will decide which attacks are available to the player, their strength being dependant on the craracters stats.
	
	every character will also have armor slots, and artifacts, the latter will buff their stats.

(im currently trying to work on these two on the side)
