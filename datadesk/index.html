<header><h1>Datadesk: What is it?</h1></header>
<article>
<p>The worst document format that exists, and why i made it.</p>
<h2 id="but-tell-me-what-the-fuck-is-it">But tell me: What the fuck is it?</h2>
<p>Datadesk (DS) is an interpreted markup language that bridges the gap between images and text files.
Characters and sentences are placed by the user on a matrix.</p>
<p>DS has 4 main commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>/s - writes a sentence to the screen, automatically placing multiple lines until the end of the command (/e).</li>
<li>/r - draws a rectangle on the screen.</li>
<li>/e - ends the /s command (and every command that has a dynamic argument number).</li>
<li>/  - used only once, &ldquo;/&rdquo; means the scene root in a datadesk source file.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a line numbering argument for /s evoked by the letter &ldquo;L&rdquo; like this: <code>/sL</code></p>
<p>The language uses a pass-based syntax in which the return key separates different passes.
This approach makes writing software with datadesk in mind really easy.
It works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st pass: the y coordinate</li>
<li>2nd pass: the x coordinate</li>
<li>3rd pass: the command / a character</li>
</ul>
<p>If the 3rd pass is a command there are arguments after the pass; Technically these are called &ldquo;Optional passes&rdquo;.
The y coordinate is specified first because ncurses works the same way.
Even if it feels weird at first, it is really simple in the long run.
This decision makes sense because people first specify the row (y), and then the column (x).</p>
<h2 id="the-drawer-interpreter">The DRAWER interpreter.</h2>
<p>DRAWER (DRAWER Reference Alpha-stage Working without Errors and it&rsquo;s Robust as fuck) interpreter, is a ncurses based DS interpreter made by me from scratch.
Currently it only has around 200 lines of code and it&rsquo;s extremely minimal. You can use DRAWER with the following command.</p>
<p><code>drawer &lt;path to the ds source file.ds&gt;</code></p>
<p>The document is shown after the execution of that command, you can close the interpreter with F12.
<code>drawer -h</code> shows you the version of drawer and cli arguments that you can use with it.
<code>drawer -d</code> shows you a datadesk demo file containing some nice art, graphics etc.</p>
<h2 id="datadesk-the-sequel-what-will-follow-ds1">Datadesk: The sequel (what will follow DS1?)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently planning on adding support on multiple pages in the same document and adding variables.
Maybe i will do things such as block quotes and support for slanted and bold text.</p>
<p>DS3 will probably have some interactive elements added as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-to-your-previous-project-allcom">What happened to your previous project, allcom?</h2>
<p>I lost motivation and cancelled the game. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
