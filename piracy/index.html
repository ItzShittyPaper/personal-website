<header><h1>Piracy is 80% morally correct</h1></header>
<article>
<p><em>&ldquo;this will be a controversial one&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 id="is-piracy-stealing">Is Piracy Stealing?</h2>
<p>No, not at all.
Unlike real piracy (a group of guys goes into a boat in the middle of the fucking ocean and steals everything) nothing just ceases to exist.
So technically it is just unauthorized file copying, which sounds stupid because everyone can copy files on their disk in any capacity.</p>
<p>Even then, let&rsquo;s be honest.
Stealing (like real stealing) from big corporations doesn&rsquo;t hurt them much + nobody cares about them (outside of the apple community where apple inc. is their lord and savior).</p>
<h2 id="what-about-that-20">What about that 20%?</h2>
<p>That 20% is mostly stuff that is already illegal, or it&rsquo;s just immoral anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Porn (don&rsquo;t coom kids.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child Po- Cheese Pizza</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Why would you download this, yes downloading this stuff from torrent with a VPN is safe (kind of) but why?)</p>
<ul>
<li>Some indie games made by a guy in his basement worth for five bucks (not talking about AAA&rsquo;s)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Like these people actually want to make something good, support them. But still &ldquo;no tux, no bux&rdquo; is a rule that i&rsquo;ll follow.)</p>
<h2 id="the-bittorrent-protocol-itself">The BitTorrent protocol itself</h2>
<p>I like torrents mostly because the BitTorrent protocol revolutionized the Internet.
It was created when your average internet connection was around 50 KB/s, and most people still used dial-up.
But why it was so revolutional?</p>
<p>First, it is very hard to shut down a torrent network - that&rsquo;s why it is so commonly used for piracy and rare / lost media archival.
Back in the day most websites were owned by people, not companies. A side effect of this was that servers of a website could be shut down at any time due to many reasons. The creator of that site could be bored, forgot to turn on his server etc.
Obviously, when the servers are down, you cannot download stuff from this person. BitTorrent is decentralized, so everyone having the file on his own computer is a potential server. Only one person online (more popular torrents have even 50 people at the same time) can keep the torrent up and send the data to you.
Because of this decentralization, most companies can&rsquo;t stop even a single torrent.</p>
<p>Aside from that, download speeds of the files sent through torrent weren&rsquo;t capped by the server, so these files could be downloaded with very high speeds.
These reasons are all i need to prefer torrent over anything else.</p>
<h2 id="how-2-interwebz-pirate">how 2 interwebz pirate</h2>
<p>First, you need to know what is a torrent tracker.
A torrent tracker is a server that - as the name suggests - tracks peers across many torrent networks. Most of these trackers are aggregated and hosted on sites like:</p>
<ul>
<li>thepiratebay.org</li>
<li>1337x.to</li>
<li>rutracker.org (it&rsquo;s in russian, some basic language skills required to use it on a daily basis)</li>
</ul>
<p>these are sites that i prefer to use.</p>
<p>How to download files from them? It&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<ol>
<li>go to the website (example is from thepiratebay.org)</li>
<li>search what you want</li>
<li>click on it (and avoid ads when possible)</li>
<li>click on the button with da magnet</li>
</ol>
<p>your client should appear and set up the torrent for you by now.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>relax and wait till the thing completes.</li>
<li>now you have your favourite music album, hentai game, or something else on your hard drive!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>
<p>So that was it, i hope this guide to torrents was useful.</p>
