<header><h1>sleep deprivation bingo: a weirdly personal blogpost</h1></header>
<article>
<p><em>yaaay, another post on my blog.</em>
<em>it&rsquo;s been a long time since i posted anything here.</em></p>
<p>Today i want to talk about sleep deprivation a bit. Mostly because the last few months were really hard for me, and due to burnout and me being generally overworked I haven&rsquo;t been getting enough sleep lately. For a long time I coped with it with high caffeine consumption - mostly coffee and energy drinks. This usually works fine, but living on a combination of drugs, caffeine and self-determination isn&rsquo;t very healthy long-term. My heart is probably broken beyond repair now lol.</p>
<p>I started working on my game engine in the meantime. Now it only fuels one or two shitty meme games, but i plan on making it one of the better 2D engines out there. I want it to be capable while not compromising on performance, usability be damned. I also started working on a new album, something actually good. I&rsquo;m also experimenting with vocals for some songs, so it won&rsquo;t be all instrumental shit with some occasional stolen vox sample. Usually im really embarrassed of talking to the microphone so it&rsquo;s hard for me to do all that, and I have to try and fix the shitty audio in post, which rarely works. Such is like I guess. BTW im also working on a bandcamp page for my music, so that it won&rsquo;t be tied to my website anymore.</p>
<p>Ok enough of the music and programming stuff that ate up all of my summer holidays: Am I the only one that feels like that person everyone relies on, but no one cares about? Many people ask me to do stuff for them, but then just shut up for a while and don&rsquo;t talk to me. It&rsquo;s weird being honest. Some people just straight up insult me after talking to me for some time. I feel like the best method of talking to people is to just cut them off for a month and then meeting them again on purpose pretending you forgot about them.</p>
<p>Ehh&hellip; I&rsquo;m getting pretty tired. Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?
I should slowly do less stuff in a day, maybe quit one of my hobbies? idk
Have fun, and a nice sleep.</p>
