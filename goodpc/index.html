<header><h1>You DON&#39;T NEED a good PC</h1></header>
<article>
<p>here&rsquo;s a simple way to have more money. for free!</p>
<h1 id="what-do-you-need">What do you need?</h1>
<p>First, we need to specify how we use computers.
Here are some of the more performance-heavy things that people use PCs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio / Video / Image Editing</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Web Browsing</li>
<li>Text Editing / Programming</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably could do all of these things on a 400$ box.
But how?</p>
<h1 id="lower-you-expectations">Lower you expectations.</h1>
<p>Yes, really.
The most important thing is to lower your expectations and stop fearing change.
You need to basically realize that you don&rsquo;t need to play -  i don&rsquo;t know, Soyberpunk 2077 with raytracing.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t fear, it is almost always the programmers fault!</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s take Minecraft.
The OG edition of the game is written in java.
Because it was written in java in 2009, the game code runs mostly single-threaded and isn&rsquo;t optimized.
When microsoft decided to make an UWP version of minecraft for windows 10, the xbox and mobile devices - they decided to rewrite the engine in C++.
The results are that in the java version of the game, the max. world render distance is 64 (with optimization mods!).
In the C++ version it&rsquo;s the default.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a small issue compared to&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="muh-heckin-web-browsers11">mUh HeCkIn WeB bRoWsErS1!1!!</h1>
<p>I think it is safe to say it: the web is beyond repair.
The sites are bloated, the browsers are bloated, the languages are bloated.
EVERYTHING. IS. BLOATED.</p>
<p>I genuinely think that without a decent PC you can&rsquo;t browse the internet comfortably.
For example, Firefox starts up on my PC (it&rsquo;s pretty beefy, even if the OS is installed on an HDD) in around 5 - 10 seconds.
In comparison - starting up Firefox on my Thinkpad x230 takes 30 seconds.
The worst thing is that there aren&rsquo;t any browsers that are really faster and have good website support, and chromium has the same issues.</p>
<p>(yes, i know that surf exists, dont @ me)</p>
<p>Even if web browsers were more optimized, they would still have high system requirements due to the web technologies themselves.
Websites really shouldn&rsquo;t compile 25 megabytes of javascript.
If your site requires javascript to function - it probably shouldn&rsquo;t be a website.
Web developers should focus more on stripping down the javascript, not on making the site unusable.</p>
<h1 id="so-how-to-actually-have-a-better-pc-for-free">So how to actually have a better PC for free</h1>
<ol>
<li>Install linux</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, it is required, and you won&rsquo;t escape from it.
You can play almost every game on linux already (from my experience), so there aren&rsquo;t any reasons to not jump ship.
Windows always was the most bloated OS on the market, and it&rsquo;s mere existence is constantly pushing hardware manufacturers to release overpriced, power-hungry CPU&rsquo;s and GPU&rsquo;s.
As for my recommendation - if you want a huge performance boost, just install linux. I would suggest Linux Mint MATE edition.</p>
<ol>
<li>(OPTIONAL) Install BSD</li>
</ol>
<p>if you got the balls to do it. do it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Optimize your OS.</li>
</ol>
<p>on windows you really can&rsquo;t truly optimize your system, so i&rsquo;ll just explain what to do on UNIX-based systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a more lightweight graphical environment.
For example if you use KDE, install XFCE. If you use XFCE, install a tiling window manager etc.
Configuring a tiling WM can be hard, but it will always be way faster than GNOME / KDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t mind wayland you could even use (for gaming) the gamescope compositor made by valve for the steam deck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary services running in the background
Get rid of plymouth, sshd and other stuff you don&rsquo;t need, you could theoretically not use a display manager and instead use cli login with .bashrc xorg autostart.
It will basically save you ram, and maybe even CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stop running other aplications while gaming.</li>
</ol>
<p>It will greatly increase availible RAM.
Needed for 4GB (or less) ram systems.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Lower your resolution in games (if you can)</li>
</ol>
<p>AMD&rsquo;s FSR works on linux without any problems (you can enable it via lutris or in gamescope). if you have a 1920x1080 screen you could just upscale from 1280x720 or 1600x900.
It will increase performance with little loss of visual quality.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Don&rsquo;t enable the FPS counter</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little psychological trick.
Just stop caring about the FPS and find the settings that you could play on, without setting the barrier to 60 fps or 30.
Most people could probably play comfortably in 48 fps, and in some games even 24 fps without even knowing it.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>(OPTIONAL) Sell your PC and buy &ldquo;a better one&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>It sounds stupid, but with experience you could buy some way better parts for the same price.
You could basically in a few weeks get a 20 - 50% performance boost just by picking your PC parts better.
Also you can just add a couple of bucks to your budget and buy a objectively better computer with a very small price increase (let&rsquo;s say 20 - 50$).</p>
<h1 id="start-using-software-that-actually-cares-about-performance">Start using software that actually cares about performance.</h1>
<p>There is a ton of FOSS software that runs a lot better than all of it&rsquo;s proprietary counterparts.
You&rsquo;d be suprised that you could edit videos, do VFX, produce music and code comfortably on a 250$ box.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of such software.</p>
<p>3D / VFX software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blender</li>
<li>Natron</li>
</ul>
<p>Video Editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blender</li>
<li>Kdenlive</li>
<li>Olive</li>
<li>Shoutcut</li>
<li>Handbrake (a media transcoding program)</li>
</ul>
<p>Music Production software / plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ardour</li>
<li>OpenMPT</li>
<li>Milkytracker</li>
<li>Calf Plugins</li>
<li>Linux Studio Plugins</li>
<li>Claudia Patchbay</li>
<li>Carla Rack</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphics:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP</li>
<li>Inkscape (for vector graphics)</li>
<li>Krita (for drawing and 2D animation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Blocks</li>
<li>VS Codium</li>
<li>Vim (dont beat me it&rsquo;s a joke)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>When i built my home server, it had a shit GPU (and 7$ Nvidia NVS 300)
I found out that even then it had decent performance in games like Half-Life 2 or Xonotic.
This inspired me to make that article.</p>
<p>Use your 10 dollar PCs, install gentoo and have fun getting max performance out from you computers!</p>
