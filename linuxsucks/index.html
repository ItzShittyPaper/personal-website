<header><h1>Linux is dead (and we killed it)</h1></header>
<article>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s just my opinion. But Linux is truly dead.
It has become unstable, bloated and unusable. Even Windows beats most popular distros in that regard.</p>
<p>Even &ldquo;pro&rdquo; distributions like Arch or Gentoo suffer from most of the problems that modern UNIX has.
An example that i like to use is NetworkManager, a truly useless piece of software.
This deamon really is just a workaround that makes systemd&rsquo;s network system usable to your average Joe.</p>
<p>Other init-systems like openrc and runit just work.
Yes - they require a dhcp service (if you even use dhcp) - but even then these init systems ship with at least working network setup tools.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s analyze the downfall of Linux in detail</p>
<h2 id="the-desktop">The Desktop</h2>
<p>For me it all started with GNOME 3.
I know I sound stupid because everyone bullies GNOME and systemd, but hear me out.</p>
<p>GNOME 2 was perfect.
Ok, maybe not. Still it was really close to perfection. Why?
It was easy to use, stable and customizable - everything you want from a desktop.</p>
<p>But then, from nowhere - gnome 3 appeared.
They have scrapped everything they built since the 90s and started from scratch.
And it wasn&rsquo;t a success, actually, it was the Windows Vista of linux.</p>
<p>If someone came to my house with a gun and said &ldquo;describe what gnome 3 in 2011 was in 5 seconds or i&rsquo;ll shoot you&rdquo; i would say that it was janky, very janky.
I didn&rsquo;t understand why the dev-team did this, and i don&rsquo;t understand it now.
After some time the GNOME team fixed their desktop, and it was actually pretty easy to use.
Most popular distributions like ubuntu returned to their roots with shipping gnome again.
But while all of this was happening, gnome 3 was the literal definition of a &ldquo;dumpster fire&rdquo; under the hood.
Through time the team added too many unneceseary features to gnome and added systemd dependencies.
Because of the popularity of systemd, no one saw this as a problem. But it really is.
Now with GNOME 42 using 2 gigs idling i can confortably say that it won&rsquo;t ever go back to it&rsquo;s days of glory.</p>
<p>KDE had gone a simillar route, but with a happier ending overall.
KDE 3 was the best alternative to GNOME 2, and the most customizable desktop of it&rsquo;s time.
In 2008 / 2009 KDE 4 was released. And you guessed it - it was a total disaster.
Everybody hated this thing, it was barely usable. At least GNOME 3 didn&rsquo;t crashed almost every time you wanted to change a theme.
The succesor to KDE 4, Plasma is actually very successful to this day. It mostly reclaimed the desktop throne from KDE 3 / Trinity, and it is the favourite to this day.
But it didn&rsquo;t protect KDE from it&rsquo;s jank.</p>
<h3 id="kde-plasma-jank-list">KDE Plasma jank list</h3>
<ol>
<li>a ton of confusing menus</li>
<li>QT5 is still a mess</li>
<li>Uses even more ram than GNOME</li>
<li>Outdated widgets</li>
<li>Feature Creep</li>
<li>Weird Design Choices</li>
<li>A shitty store app</li>
<li>Broken, unfinished app suite</li>
<li>Breeze theme is the only one that is actually usable and integrates with GTK</li>
<li>Unpolished, buggy animations</li>
<li>Bugs</li>
<li>Bugs!</li>
<li>Even More Bugs!</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s end it here.</p>
<h2 id="systemd">systemd</h2>
<p>From the other side of our linux coin is <strong>systemd</strong>, a linux init system that creeped into every distro since Debian 7 codenamed &ldquo;Jessie&rdquo;
Most people just don&rsquo;t care enough about linux&rsquo;s internal workings to hate systemd - it is still a usable and easy to use init system.
I know that it&rsquo;s a meme, but systemd really is the most bloated PID1 that ever existed, having a ton of useless services that shouldn&rsquo;t even be there.</p>
<h3 id="the-not-so-comprehensive-list-of-useless-soystemd-wonk-and-jank">The not-so comprehensive list of useless soystemd wonk and jank</h3>
<ol>
<li>systemd-homed</li>
<li>systemd-logind</li>
<li>systemd-boot</li>
<li>systemd/Journal (yes, there are multiple naming conventions used there)</li>
<li>systemd-sysusers</li>
<li>systemd-nspawn</li>
<li>systemd-stub</li>
<li>systemd.mount (another naming convention)</li>
<li>systemd-fstab-generator (WHY, JUST WHY. <code>genfstab</code> exists.)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>all of these systemd modules shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of the init system, but they somehow are&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from systemd&rsquo;s disregard of the UNIX philosophy, it boots significantly slower than for example runit or s6 (at least on all of my machines).
It is really a beast, a performance hog and it simply just does too much. PID 1 should just start some services with dependency management and that&rsquo;s it.
Another big thing that i hate is <strong>pulseaudio</strong>, even if it is being currently replaced by pipewire (and that&rsquo;s really good) - it is a wonky mess that never works,
uses too much system resources, isn&rsquo;t system-wide, has horrible command-line interfaces and is just simply buggy.
We should stick to alsa in the long-term. Why?
It simply just works, yes - only after extensive configuration to let it work on modern browsers, add multi-channel support etc. - but it works.</p>
<p>The mentality of <em>Lennart Poettering&rsquo;s</em> software is spreading too.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-freedom-anyway">What is Freedom anyway?</h2>
<p>Freedom in linux is decaying.
Most people are forced to use pulseaudio (because of steam and other stuff), X.Org (wayland exists, but it isn&rsquo;t as stable), systemd (because gnome) and other things.
In the early days of linux there really was more choice than now.
In the 90s and early 2000s, when UNIX systems came to your average Joe, people used BSDs, Linuxes, BeOS etc.
Now it&rsquo;s just ubuntu and arch.</p>
<p>People started realizing this and now some are moving to BSD or - if someone doesn&rsquo;t care about privacy - MacOS.
I suspect that in a few years most popular linux distros will be closer to windows than to any free-software UNIX imaginable.
But let&rsquo;s end this for now.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Linux users wanting it to be more &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo; killed linux. Yes, it is more integrated - but at what cost?
GNOME 3 and systemd are the greatest examples of this trend.</p>
