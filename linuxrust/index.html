<header><h1>Linux gets Rusty: My Response</h1></header>
<article>
<p>all i can say is: Why?</p>
<h1 id="oxidization">Oxidization</h1>
<p>first, we need to look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Rust is a new multi-paradigm programming language now commonly used for desktop applications and utilities.
It&rsquo;s biggest &ldquo;pros&rdquo; are efficiency and memory safety.
For context i will just add that Rust is popular among the software development community.
Especially the more &ldquo;Leftist&rdquo; side of it.</p>
<p>Linux is implementing Rust simply because there aren&rsquo;t as many C developers as one would think.
Most senior developers working on low-level code are now retired - or dead.
Every year people are stepping down from the kernel and moving on with their lives.
Basically - C is a dead language that zoomers are too afraid to learn, and the supply of people programming in it is quickly depleting.</p>
<h1 id="blahaj-programmer-socks-and-rust">Blahaj, Programmer Socks, and Rust</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s debunk Rust into oblivion, shall we?</p>
<ol>
<li>Efficiency</li>
</ol>
<p>Rust is more efficient than its biggest competitor, C++ - at least in most cases.
It&rsquo;s mostly because unlike C++ it doesn&rsquo;t have garbage collection.
Instead it uses the concepts of <em>ownership</em> and <em>borrowing</em>.
Ownership basically is a system in which memory is automatically freed when a variable is not needed.
This generally saves memory space, but increases CPU usage and can lead to some other problems.
In C, developer does this manually with the <code>free()</code> function. Even if this is not needed in most cases.</p>
<p>Basically, C is much faster, and modern C compilers can compile memory leak-less code without much trouble.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Memory Safety</li>
</ol>
<p>Rust fanboys think that it&rsquo;s 100% memory safe. And it&rsquo;s a lie.
Rust in no way guarantees memory safety.
The only difference between &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; languages like C and rust, is that the Rust compiler flags unsafe code as errors that you need to correct.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>eVeRyThInG iS gOiNg To Be ReWrItTeN iN rUsT!!1!</li>
</ol>
<p>Rust isn&rsquo;t nearly as universal as most femboys on hacker news think.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>C++ iS dEd!!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>nah, people will still use C++ because of legacy compatibility and a ton C / C++ libraries that will never be usable with other languages.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<h1 id="the-kernel-of-c">The <em>kernel</em> of C</h1>
<p>Still, <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> Rust support is being added to the upcoming linux 6.1 release.
Most distributions will include Rust maybe in a year or two.</p>
<p>Some of them will probably disable Rust support for some time after the 6.1 release, as it is currently optional.</p>
<h1 id="if-it-moves-compile-it">If It Moves, Compile It</h1>
<p>My biggest critic of Rust in the kernel is the time it takes to compile.
Another language in the build toolchain will basically make the kernel twice as heavy to run and build.</p>
<p>Linux was historically a very lightweight kernel, despite of it&rsquo;s monolithic nature.
Now it is becoming more and more bloated.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in my previous blog post, but corporate sponsors are one of the main reasons things like Rust get included in the kernel.
In a few years many people with low-end hardware will probably need to change their setup because of this change (and many others).</p>
<p>Basically, sticking to facts: soon compiling the kernel will take around 8 hours on mid-range hardware. imagine using gentoo with these compile times!</p>
<h1 id="but-should-you">But Should You?</h1>
<p>My conclusion:</p>
<p>for now i&rsquo;ll try use linux even with all of this.
but in the future? i will probably switch to BSD.
even without some games, i should be fine with the linux binary compatibility.
idk.</p>
<p>goodbye.</p>
